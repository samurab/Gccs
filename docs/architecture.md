# Architecture

## MVP Posture

The first release is a No-CUI compliance management SaaS. Users should be prevented from uploading CUI until the platform has the right enclave design, customer terms, shared responsibility matrix, logging, access controls, and assessment posture.

## Application Boundaries

- `apps/web`: Next.js UI for profile, contracts, obligations, evidence, calendar, CMMC readiness, subcontractors, and reporting.
- `apps/api`: ASP.NET Core API exposing tenant-scoped compliance workflows.
- `src/Gccs.Domain`: Core model with no framework dependencies.
- `src/Gccs.Application`: Use cases, ports, and DTOs.
- `src/Gccs.Infrastructure`: database, object storage, queue, search, AI, and external API adapters.
- `packages/compliance-content`: source-backed obligation seed data reviewed by compliance experts before production use.

## Planned Services

- PostgreSQL for transactional tenant data.
- Object storage for evidence files.
- Redis for cache and background job coordination.
- Queue worker for document extraction, notifications, malware scanning, and report generation.
- Search over curated compliance content and tenant documents.
- RAG service limited to cited internal and curated sources.

## Security Baseline

- MFA and SSO-ready auth.
- RBAC and tenant isolation.
- TLS everywhere.
- Encryption at rest.
- Immutable audit log.
- Malware scanning for uploads.
- Least-privilege administrative access.
- Backup, retention, export, and deletion workflows.
